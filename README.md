# Carbon-Emissions-Analysis-in-the-Permian-Basin


## Introduction:
The aim of this project is to develop a system that collects and analyzes data on carbon emissions in the Permian Basin region. The Permian Basin is a significant oil and gas-producing region, and monitoring carbon emissions is crucial for assessing environmental impact, identifying emission hotspots, ensuring compliance with regulations, and suggesting strategies for emissions reduction.

## Data Collection
To collect data on carbon emissions, the system will integrate with various sources such as power plants, industrial facilities, and regulatory bodies. Data sources may include emission reports, monitoring systems, satellite data, and environmental databases. The system will use APIs, web scraping, and data integration techniques to collect and consolidate the required data.

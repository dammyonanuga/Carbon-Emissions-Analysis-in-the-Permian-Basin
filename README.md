# Carbon-Emissions-Analysis-in-the-Permian-Basin


## Introduction:
The aim of this project is to develop a system that collects and analyzes data on carbon emissions in the Permian Basin region. The Permian Basin is a significant oil and gas-producing region, and monitoring carbon emissions is crucial for assessing environmental impact, identifying emission hotspots, ensuring compliance with regulations, and suggesting strategies for emissions reduction.

## Data Collection
To collect data on carbon emissions, the system will integrate with various sources such as
